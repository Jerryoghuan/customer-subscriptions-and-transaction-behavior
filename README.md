## Customer Subscription & Transaction Insights  
### Performance Analysis, Recommendations, and Business Impact (2020–2022)

This dashboard analyzes customer subscriptions and transaction behavior across three plans (Basic, Max, Pro) over a three-year period. It focuses on revenue performance, customer growth, churn, and acquisition channels across Nordic markets.

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Revenue Concentration by Plan

- **Max plan generates the highest revenue** at approximately $438K, despite having fewer customers than Basic and Pro.
- **Basic plan has the largest customer base** but the lowest revenue per customer.
- **Pro plan sits in the middle**, with moderate revenue and customer count but relatively high churn.

**Insight:**  
Revenue is driven more by **plan value and pricing** than by customer volume alone.

---

### 2. Churn Rate Is a Major Revenue Leak

- Basic plan shows **very high churn**, exceeding 15%, with significant revenue loss year over year.
- Pro plan churn remains elevated, reducing long-term customer value.
- Max plan has the **lowest churn**, even while generating the most revenue.

**Insight:**  
Higher-value customers are more stable. Lower-tier plans attract volume but fail to retain customers.

---

### 3. Year-over-Year Growth Is Uneven

- Max plan shows strong year-over-year revenue growth, especially in peak months.
- Basic plan struggles with inconsistent growth and sharp dips, indicating weak customer stickiness.
- Pro plan growth exists but is partially offset by churn-driven losses.

**Insight:**  
Growth is not uniform. Some plans are scaling efficiently, while others grow and lose customers at the same time.

---

### 4. Acquisition Channels Are Heavily Skewed

- Google Ads and Facebook dominate customer acquisition across all plans.
- Organic search and paid search contribute meaningfully but trail far behind.
- Display and Bing have minimal impact.

**Insight:**  
Marketing spend is concentrated in a few channels, creating dependency risk and limiting acquisition efficiency.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Reposition the Basic Plan

- Reduce reliance on Basic as a long-term revenue driver.
- Introduce:
  - Usage limits
  - Time-based upgrades
  - Clear upgrade nudges to Max or Pro

**Goal:**  
Turn Basic into a **conversion funnel**, not a retention product.

---

### 2. Protect and Scale the Max Plan

- Prioritize retention strategies for Max customers:
  - Loyalty incentives
  - Annual billing discounts
  - Priority support or premium features
- Allocate more marketing budget to Max-focused campaigns.

**Goal:**  
Maximize lifetime value from the most profitable and stable customer segment.

---

### 3. Address Pro Plan Churn

- Investigate why Pro customers churn at a higher rate than Max.
- Possible actions:
  - Clarify value differentiation between Pro and Max
  - Improve onboarding and early engagement
  - Offer targeted retention campaigns at churn-risk points

**Goal:**  
Prevent Pro from becoming a high-cost, low-retention tier.

---

### 4. Optimize Marketing Spend by ROI, Not Volume

- Re-evaluate underperforming channels (Display, Bing).
- Shift budget toward channels with:
  - Higher retention
  - Higher plan upgrades
  - Better lifetime value, not just sign-ups

**Goal:**  
Acquire fewer customers, but better customers.
